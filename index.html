      <h2> Rules to the game </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Scoring</h3></li>
        <p>
          Both players start at zero points called "love". Once a player wins one point their score increases to 30. 
          The next point after 30 increases the player's score to 40. In simple terms, if that player wins another point, 
          then that player wins the game. There are conditions where a player has to win by two. In that case if the the 
          score becomes 40-40, then a player must win 2 consecutive points to win. If at 40-40 one player wins one point 
          (the add point) and the other player wins the next point, then the score goes back to 40-40.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Serving</h3></li>
        <p>
          One player is considered the server for a whole game, and the server rotates between games. In one game, the 
          server starts serving on their right side from the baseline to get the ball in the service box located diagonally 
          over the net. Throughout the game, the server rotates each point serving from either the right side (deuce side) 
          or left side (add side).

      <ul>
        <li><h3>Backhand</h3></li>
        <p>
          A backhand is hit on your non dominant side with both hands.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Forehand</h3></li>
        <p>
          A forehand is hit on you dominant side with your dominant hand.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Serve</h3></li>
        <p>
          A serve is when the server throws the ball up and hits it over the net to start the point.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Volley</h3></li>
        <p>
          A volley occurs when a player hits the ball without it bouncing first.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Net</h3></li>
        <p>
          The net goes across the middle of the court.

      <ul>
        <li><h3>Service line</h3></li>
        <p>
          The service line is the line close to the net running parallel to the net.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Base line</h3></li>
        <p>
          The base line is the line farthest from the net running parallel to the net.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Service boxes</h3></li>
        <p>
          The service boxes are formed between the service line, net, and alleys.
